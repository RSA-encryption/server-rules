# Server Rules

This is a simple sourcemod plugin for displaying a rule list to new clients when they join your server.

They will be kicked if they choose to disagree, or fail to agree within 45 seconds.

#### Installation:
1. Download the archive [from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ennynwjvm18ms83/server-rules.v1.1.tar.gz?dl=1) and place it inside of the server mod's folder. (Ex: `/home/steam/steamcmd/csgo-ds/csgo/`)
2. Extract with `tar xvzf server-rules.v1.1.tar.bz2`.
3. Edit the rule list in `addons/sourcemod/configs/ServerRules.txt` with your own rules.
4. Load the plugin through the console.
